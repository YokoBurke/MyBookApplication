# MyBookApplication
I created this application to review below items I learned in the online programming class.

1. AsyncTask
2. JSON Pursing
3. Http Connection

By using the app, user can search for a book list using a keyword.
Booklist is obtained from www.googleapis.com API.
Simply enter the keyword and either click on search button or hit enter.
